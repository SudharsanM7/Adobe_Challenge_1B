# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence - Methodology Explanation

## Core Approach

Our solution implements a sophisticated persona-aware document analysis pipeline that extracts and prioritizes content based on user roles and specific job requirements. The system combines advanced natural language processing with domain-specific heuristics to deliver targeted document intelligence.

## Methodology Framework

### Document Processing Pipeline
The system begins with robust PDF parsing using PyMuPDF, extracting text while preserving structural information. Our enhanced section detection algorithm identifies document hierarchy through multiple signals: numbered patterns (1., 2.1, 2.1.1), formatting cues (font size, bold text), and domain-specific keywords. This multi-layered approach ensures accurate content segmentation across diverse document types.

### Persona Analysis Engine
We analyze input personas and job descriptions using NLP techniques including tokenization, stemming, and stopword filtering. The system maintains domain-specific keyword vocabularies for different user types:
- **Travel Planners**: Prioritizes practical information (accommodations, activities, dining, transportation)
- **Researchers**: Focuses on methodological content (data, experiments, analysis, results)
- **Business Analysts**: Emphasizes financial metrics (revenue, market trends, performance indicators)

### Intelligent Relevance Scoring
Our composite scoring algorithm evaluates section relevance through five weighted factors:
1. **Semantic Similarity (30%)**: TF-IDF cosine similarity between section content and persona requirements
2. **Domain Keyword Matching (25%)**: Weighted scoring for role-specific terminology
3. **Title Relevance (25%)**: Direct alignment between section headers and job tasks
4. **Section Type Importance (15%)**: Inherent value of different content categories
5. **Quality Adjustments (5%)**: Length penalties and baseline scoring

### Content Extraction Strategy
The system ranks all document sections by relevance scores, selecting the top-performing content for output. For granular analysis, we implement intelligent subsection extraction that:
- Segments long content into meaningful chunks using sentence boundary detection
- Scores text segments based on keyword density and persona alignment
- Maintains optimal length while preserving contextual coherence
- Ensures diverse representation across source documents

### Performance Optimization
Our CPU-only implementation uses lightweight algorithms to meet strict performance constraints:
- Vectorized operations through scikit-learn for efficient similarity computation
- Streaming document processing to minimize memory footprint
- Optimized text processing pipelines achieving sub-60 second execution
- Scalable architecture handling 3-10 documents efficiently

### Domain Adaptability
The system's generic design enables cross-domain effectiveness through:
- Automatic domain detection based on persona and job characteristics
- Dynamic keyword weighting adjusted for specific use cases
- Flexible section recognition accommodating various document structures
- Configurable relevance criteria supporting diverse application scenarios

## Quality Assurance
Multi-layered validation ensures output quality through relevance verification, duplicate prevention, format compliance, and graceful error handling. The system maintains high precision in section selection while delivering comprehensive coverage of user-relevant content.

This methodology delivers persona-specific document intelligence that connects what matters most for each unique user and their specific objectives.
