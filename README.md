# Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview
This solution extracts and prioritizes relevant content from document collections based on specific user personas and their job requirements. It processes 3-10 PDFs to identify the most important sections and subsections for targeted users.

## Features
- **Multi-domain support**: Travel planning, academic research, business analysis
- **Intelligent section ranking**: Combines semantic similarity with domain expertise
- **Granular content extraction**: Provides detailed subsection analysis
- **Fast processing**: Completes analysis within 60 seconds
- **CPU-optimized**: No GPU requirements, runs on standard hardware

## Architecture
The system implements a four-stage pipeline:
1. **Document Processing**: PDF parsing with structure detection
2. **Persona Analysis**: Role and job requirement understanding
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor content evaluation
4. **Content Extraction**: Section ranking and subsection analysis

## Technical Stack
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF for robust text extraction
- **NLP**: NLTK for text processing and tokenization
- **ML**: Scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity
- **Performance**: Lightweight algorithms optimized for CPU execution

## Input Requirements
- **Documents**: 3-10 related PDF files
- **Persona**: User role description with expertise areas
- **Job**: Specific task the persona needs to accomplish
- **Format**: JSON configuration with document references

## Output Format
